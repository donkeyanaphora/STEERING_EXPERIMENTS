# Notes on Austin's "Other Minds"

## Page 1: The Question "How do you know?"

What sort of things do people say when asked "How do you know?"

Simple but not statements like those of current empirical fact, e.g.:
- "That is a goldfinch"
- "The kettle is boiling"

These are statements we are liable to be asked "How do you know?"

To which we can respond that we don't *know*, we *believe*.

```
"The kettle is boiling"
"How do you know?"
        ↙      ↘
     know     believe
```

## Page 2: Know vs. Believe Branching

### Example 1: The Goldfinch
```
A: "There is a goldfinch in the garden"
B: "Do you know there is?"
           ↙          ↘
A:      "Yes"        "No, but I think/believe there is"
          ↓                    ↓
B: "How do you know?"        "Why?"
```

### Example 2: Anger
```
A: "He is angry"
B: "Do you know he is?"
           ↙          ↘
A:      "Yes"        "No but I think he is"
          ↓                    ↓
B: "How do you know?"        "Why?"
```

### Key Distinction

| "How do you know?" | "Why do you believe?" |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Suggests you *don't* know | Suggests you *ought not* believe |
| | But doesn't imply you *don't* believe |

**"The existence of the alleged belief is not challenged"**

## Page 3: Knowledge vs. Certainty

Only knowledge is [challenged?].

**Key insight (p. 79):**

If we like to say "I believe," "I'm sure," "I'm certain" are descriptions of subjective mental/cognitive states/attitudes, then **"I know" is not that**, or at least not *merely* that—it functions differently.

### Example:
> "If I know, I can't be wrong"

You can always show I don't know by proving me wrong.

**This is where knowing differs from being certain, as can be.**

## Research Question

> **Thought:** Do models assign higher epistemic weight to users saying "I know" vs. "I'm certain"?
